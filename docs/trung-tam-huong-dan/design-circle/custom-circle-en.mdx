## 1. Creating a Custom Design Circle

Currently, the Custom Circle feature is in limited release and available only to invited customers. Custom Circles are created by us for businesses. Other enterprise customers who are interested may contact their sales representative. We will selectively enable this feature based on specific business needs.

Access Path: Workbench → Product Management → Custom Design Circle

## 2. Custom Circle Settings

### 2.1 Basic Circle Attributes

To modify a circle’s properties, click Settings.

You can set the circle’s basic attributes, including:

## 4. Library Usage Settings

Approval alone does not grant immediate access. You must also specify which library the member can access.

Note: A member may join multiple Custom Circles, but each module can only use one Custom Circle at a time.

To protect your assets and avoid production errors caused by external resources, you may enable or disable the option for sub-account to apply to join other Custom Circles. Only if enabled, sub-accounts can request to join.

![Library Usage Settings 2](https://ai-study1.3vjia.com/aihouse-web/53ec454c-44de-48b4-b648-e1a93655030d.png)

Once enabled sub-account to apply to join other Custom Circles, users who have joined custom circles can go to the module settings in the Circle to assign which Custom Circle library will be used for each module.

### 5.2 How to apply assets to your custom cabinets?

When using the customization module, if you want to use assets uploaded to your Design Circle—such as doors or handles—you won't be able to drag them directly from the Design Circle panel onto your cabinets. Instead, right-click and find the corresponding catalog in the cloud library.

## 6. How to Monetize with this feature?

As a Custom Circle owner, you're a high-quality content creator. Your custom library can be offered as a paid subscription on a per-account, yearly basis.

Once expired, access will be revoked unless renewed.

Both enterprise customers and retail users have growing demand for premium custom content!

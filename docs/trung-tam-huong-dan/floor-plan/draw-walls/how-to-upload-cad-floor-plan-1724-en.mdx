2.  **Uploading Multiple Floor Plans:**
    If you are uploading multiple floor plans, it is necessary to connect them with straight lines and then import them in DWG format.

3.  **Notes for the Old Version:**
    If you are using an older version of AiHouse, please note the following:
    *   The file must be in **DXF format**.
    *   The CAD file should not contain any other lines such as those representing doors, windows, columns, or balconies. Only the wall lines should be present.

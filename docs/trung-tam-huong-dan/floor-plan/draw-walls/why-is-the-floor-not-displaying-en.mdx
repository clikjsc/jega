Hello, if the wall is transparent or the ground is empty (as well as the situation where doors and windows cannot be added to the wall), please check first:

1.  Whether there is an unclosed wall in the space. If so, delete it and redraw it to be closed. If it is a section or a wall of different heights, we can draw the wall dividly,set it's type to half wall then you can set it's height dividly;

    *(Note: The image provided in the fetched content for this step was a data URI. I am using a placeholder description. A proper image would illustrate checking for or fixing unclosed walls.)*

2.  Check the wall transparency. It is recommended to set the "opacity" to 100%;

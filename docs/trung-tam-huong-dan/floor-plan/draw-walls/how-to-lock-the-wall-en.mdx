Hello, the wall locking can lock and unlock the wall to prevent accidental pulling or changing of the wall. After unlocking, you can click to move or modify the value.

1.  **All walls**: In the design interface, click on the blank area outside the apartment layout - floor properties - lock the wall. A blue display means the wall is locked, and a gray display means the wall is unlocked;

2.  **Individual wall**: In 2D, left-click the wall with the mouse and select to lock or unlock the individual wall.

The area of the house type displayed in your plan corresponds to the area of the drawn space. If you need to modify the area of the house type, you can do so by directly modifying the length of the walls, which in turn changes the space.

Here are the steps:

**Step 1: Select the Wall**
Left-click with your mouse on the wall that is perpendicular to the dimension you want to change. This will typically highlight the wall and display its current length or related dimensions.

**Step 2: Modify the Wall Value**
Modify the wall length value that is displayed on the page. Entering a new value will adjust the wall's length and, consequently, the overall area of the space.

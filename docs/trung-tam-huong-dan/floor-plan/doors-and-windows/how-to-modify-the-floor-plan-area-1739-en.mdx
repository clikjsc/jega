To modify the area of your floor plan in AiHouse, you can adjust the positions of the walls. Hereâ€™s how:

1.  Ensure you are in the **2D state** (2D design view).
2.  Click on a wall. This will typically display the distances between this wall and adjacent walls or reference points.
3.  Click on the displayed distance value that you wish to change.
4.  Enter the new value for the distance. This will move the selected wall, thereby modifying the floor plan area.

**Important Note:** You can only modify the size (and thus the area) if the walls form a **closed space**. If there are gaps or unjoined walls, you may not be able to adjust the dimensions in this manner.

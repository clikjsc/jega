Hello, you can create an invisible door effect using stickers, custom top walls/background walls, or by selecting pre-made invisible door models. Here are the operation steps:

## Method 1: Using Stickers after Cutting a Wall Area

1.  Click on the wall where you want the invisible door.
2.  Look for a small "scissors" icon (or a similar cutting tool) typically found at the bottom of the screen or in a context menu. Use this tool to cut out the area/shape of the door on the wall surface.

3.  After cutting the area, go to the **Finishing - Decorative Map** (or a similar category for stickers/textures) and drag and place a suitable door sticker or texture onto the cut-out area to simulate the invisible door.

## Method 2: Using Custom Ceiling and Wall Function

This method involves creating a background wall for the invisible door.

1.  Enter the **Custom Ceiling and Wall** design mode.
2.  Click on "**Background Wall Design**".
3.  Draw a rectangle to define the required invisible door area.
4.  Within this area, add an integrated wallboard design.

5.  Switch to 3D mode.
6.  Drag a sticker (texture) from the library on the left to replace the texture of the designed wallboard, making it blend with the surrounding wall or achieve the desired invisible effect.

## Method 3: Using the Custom Whole Wood Module

You can directly select an invisible door model from the **Custom Whole Wood** module to add to your design.

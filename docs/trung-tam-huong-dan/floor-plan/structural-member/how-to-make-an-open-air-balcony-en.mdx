Hello, the system generates a ceiling by default for all spaces. Here are the specific operation steps for creating a terrace or an uncovered (open-air) balcony:

## Method One (Only applicable to the design version)

1.  Identify the space where you want to create a terrace.
2.  Click on the ground of that space to bring up the space attribute panel.
3.  In the attribute panel, turn off the **Ceiling** option.

Hello, irregular-shaped door openings, such as L-shaped ones, can be created in AiHouse using a couple of methods. You can either use and modify pre-existing corner bay windows or utilize free modeling tools.

## Method One: Using and Modifying a Corner Bay Window

1.  Find a suitable corner bay window model. You can often find these in the catalog under a relevant category (e.g., Aluminum Doors and Windows - Window - Corner Bay Window).
2.  Drag and place the corner bay window onto your wall.
3.  After placing it, you can click on the window and modify its size and properties in the roaming mode (3D view) to fit your requirements for an L-shaped opening.

## Method Two: Free Modeling

This method involves creating the opening from scratch using modeling tools.

1.  **Rectangular Cut:**
    *   Draw a rectangle on the wall surface where you want part of the L-shaped opening.
    *   Use a cutting or pushing tool to create an opening based on this rectangle.
    *   Repeat for the other leg of the L-shape, ensuring the two rectangular openings connect to form the L-shape.
    *   Delete any unnecessary surfaces to finalize the opening.

2.  **Arc-Shaped Corner Door Opening (if applicable for irregular shapes):**
    The original article mentions a dynamic image for creating arc-shaped corner door openings. This would involve drawing an arc and then extruding or cutting it to form the opening.

3.  **Lofting (If Required for Complex Shapes):**
    If you need to create more complex, smooth transitions for your irregular opening (like a lofted L-shape):
    *   Hold down the **Ctrl** key to select multiple lines or profiles that define the shape of your opening.
    *   Use a lofting tool/function to create a surface or solid between these selected lines, which can then be used to form the opening.

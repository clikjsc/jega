For optimal drawing and rendering results, specific camera settings are recommended. Generally, the camera should be positioned **1100 - 1300 mm** from the ground, with an angle of approximately **90 degrees** (eye-level perspective).

Here are the operational steps to achieve this:

1.  **Adjusting Perspective in Roaming Mode:**
    *   In the roaming mode (walk-through view), select the room you intend to render.
    *   Use the shortcut keys **Q, W, E, A, S, D** to adjust the camera to the approximate position you want for rendering.
    *   Use the **right mouse button to rotate** and align the perspective.
    *   **Note:** Shortcut keys for movement (Q,W,E,A,S,D) can typically only be used effectively in Google Chrome or the AiHouse client/application.

2.  **Setting Camera Parameters for Rendering:**
    *   Click on the option to generate a render effect image (e.g., "Render" button).
    *   In the rendering settings panel, enter the desired **height** and **angle** for the camera.
    *   As recommended, set the camera height to between **1100 - 1300 mm** from the ground and the angle to **90 degrees**.
    *   Click "OK" or "Render" to start the rendering process with these settings.

**Tips for 2D Perspective Lens Manipulation:**

*   **Rotating with Snap:** When rotating the 2D perspective lens (camera icon in 2D view), drag the camera to rotate. If you **hold the Shift key** while dragging, the rotation will snap to specific angles (e.g., 0, 45, 90 degrees).
*   **Moving with Snap:** When dragging the camera to move its position in 2D view, if you **hold the Shift key**, the movement can be constrained to snap to vertical or horizontal lines.

If you find that right-clicking doesn't rotate your perspective or adjust the angle as expected, please check the following possible reasons and solutions:

1.  **Mouse Button Configuration in Roaming Mode (Version 3.0 and newer):**
    *   In the new 3.0 version, the default behavior in roaming mode is:
        *   **Left mouse button:** Panning (moving the view side-to-side or up-and-down without rotation).
        *   **Right mouse button:** Rotation.
    *   If you prefer both left and right mouse buttons to perform rotation, you can change this setting:
        *   Go to **Tools - Settings - Operating Preference**.
        *   Adjust the mouse operation settings according to your preference.

2.  **Browser Compatibility:**
    *   For the best experience and full functionality, please use **Google Chrome** or the dedicated **AiHouse client/application**.
    *   Other browsers may not be fully compatible and could lead to issues with controls like right-click rotation.

3.  **Browser Cache Issues:**
    *   Sometimes, an outdated browser cache can cause problems.
    *   Try clearing your browser's cache and then log in to AiHouse again.
    *   (The original article included a link to a cache clearing tutorial: `https://pre-www.aihouse.com/work/agent/helpCenter/list/edit?id=1617` - please refer to your browser's specific instructions for clearing cache if this link is not accessible.)

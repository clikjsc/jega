## 1. Basic Operations

### Apply Partial Effects to Identical Models

*   **Highlights:**
    *   For non-lighting furniture materials, users can apply modified texture/material and size separately to identical models.
    *   For lighting materials, users can apply modified texture/material, size, color temperature, and brightness separately.
*   **Problem Solved:** Allows users to selectively apply certain changes to identical models instead of all changes at once.
*   **Feature Value:** Improves efficiency when adjusting model parameters.

</div>

*   **Steps:**
    1.  Ensure multiple identical model IDs exist on the canvas.
    2.  Modify the texture/material, size, color temperature, or brightness of one model.
    3.  Click "Apply Effects to Identical Models" and select, for example, texture/material.
    *Result: Other identical models will adopt the same texture/material.*

## 2. Customization

### 2.1 Customization Module Interface Upgrade (Major Update)

*   **Feature Highlights:**
    1.  Integrates the Custom Module, Material Hub, and Design Circle into a single interface.
    2.  Material search no longer requires switching modules; material window supports full-screen and tiled view.
    3.  Product catalog changed from dropdown interaction to tiled display.
    4.  Seamless switching between Parametric Design and Free Cabinet Design.
    5.  Users can customize sorting in their Favorites folders.
    6.  Enterprises can customize sorting of top-level categories.
*   **Optimizations:**
    1.  “My Items” in Free Cabinet moved to "Favorites".
    2.  “Material Creation” in the top menu moved to Quick Access.
    3.  The top menu’s Product Library was removed and replaced by a tiled mode.
*   **Problems Solved:**
    1.  Reduces the need to switch between modules when dragging cabinets or placing decorations.
    2.  Simplifies material search process by minimizing clicks and switching.
    3.  Supports use of third-party libraries beyond the enterprise and public libraries.

### 2.3 Process and Drawer Configuration Moved to Workbench

*   **Highlights:** Streamlines configuration management in the workbench, making it easier to maintain and apply updates uniformly.
*   **Problem Solved:** The workbench is now the platform for future feature development. The Craft Configuration and Drawer Configuration settings in AiHouse will be closed.

### 2.4 Add Drilling Method: Evenly Spaced (JEGA Advanced Version)

*   **Feature Highlights/Comparison:**
    *   Previous version used front/rear positioning, which could result in uneven spacing between holes. Some enterprises require consistent spacing between all holes.
    *   The new version introduces a Fixed Equal Spacing algorithm to ensure uniform distance between middle holes.
*   **Feature Value:** Improves hardware distribution when cabinet height is not divisible by 32, resulting in more evenly spaced holes.

### 2.6 Hinge Drilling – Door Overlay Type Configuration (JEGA Advanced Version)

*   **Previous Version:** Overlay type (full, half, inset) was hardcoded and could not be customized by the user.
*   **New Version:** Provides a configuration interface that allows users to define how the system determines overlay types based on set values. Example: Full overlay for 13–15 mm, Half overlay for 7–12 mm, Inset for 0–6 mm.

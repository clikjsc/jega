## Use Case 1: Premium Model Sharing Within Private Networks

Designers who create high-quality furniture combinations, lighting models, and other design assets can use Design Circle to share their work with the community. This feature not only enables secure sharing but also provides designers the opportunity to monetize their creations by earning from model usage and sharing.

## Use Case 2: Cross-Industry Collaboration

Design Circle enables seamless asset sharing and cooperation across different industries without the need to transfer files. The Circle owner maintains full control—managing membership, permissions to share assets, and the duration of access. This approach helps broaden business networks, enhance ecosystem efficiency, and support collaborative growth among regional enterprises.

## Use Case 3: Lead Generation for Supply Chain Platforms and Home Furnishing Brands

Supply chain platforms and home furnishing companies can create their own Design Circles, where members can access product models and place orders by linking directly to the brand’s own e-commerce platform. Membership in the Circle can be restricted to users who are registered members of the brand’s store, giving the company full control over access and management.

## Use Case 4: Local Supply Chain Circles

Design Circles can also be used to establish local supply chain networks. For example, a regional cabinetry supplier could create a circle to share their product models exclusively with local designers and contractors. This facilitates localized collaboration and streamlines the ordering process within a specific geographic area.

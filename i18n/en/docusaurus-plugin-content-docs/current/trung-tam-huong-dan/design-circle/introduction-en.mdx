## 1. What is a Design Circle?

The AiHouse Design Circle is a shared library feature that enables collaborative 3D asset sharing among users. Create circles, invite members, and share assets within your group. All members can both contribute their own assets and use those shared by others in the circle.

-   Designers: Share 3D resources like furniture layouts and lighting setups

Circle administrators can set geographic or organizational access limits.

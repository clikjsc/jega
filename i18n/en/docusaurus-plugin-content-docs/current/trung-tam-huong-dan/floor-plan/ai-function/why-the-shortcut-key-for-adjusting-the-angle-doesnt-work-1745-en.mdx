Hello, if you're finding that a specific shortcut key for "adjusting the angle" isn't working as expected, it's likely because AiHouse uses a combination of standard movement keys and mouse controls for perspective adjustment rather than a single dedicated angle key.

Please use the following shortcut keys for movement and perspective control:

*   **General Movement & Perspective:** Use the keys **Q, W, E, A, S, D** in combination with the **left mouse button to move** and the **right mouse button to rotate** the perspective.
*   You can also operate these in combination with the guide view if available.

**Note on Movement Speed:**
*   Movement is generally faster in the main 3D interface.
*   Movement is generally slower in the roaming (walk-through) mode.

**Commonly Used Movement Shortcut Keys:**

*   **Q key:** Perspective rises (move up)
*   **E key:** Perspective drops (move down)
*   **W key / "↑" (Up Arrow) key:** Perspective moves forward
*   **S key / "↓" (Down Arrow) key:** Perspective moves backward
*   **A key / "←" (Left Arrow) key:** Perspective moves left
*   **D key / "→" (Right Arrow) key:** Perspective moves right

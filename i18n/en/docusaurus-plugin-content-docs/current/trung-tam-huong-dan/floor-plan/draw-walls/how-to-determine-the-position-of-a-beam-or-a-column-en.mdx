Hello, you can input values in either 2D or 3D mode to modify and move them. Hereâ€™s the procedure using a column as an example:

### Method 1: 2D Mode

In 2D mode, left-click to select the column, and then input the value to modify the distance from the wall. (If the column is too far from the wall, the distance will not be displayed, and you will need to use Method 2 to check and modify it.)

### Method 2: 3D/Tour Mode

Switch to 3D/tour mode, left-click to select the column, click the "dimension query" ruler icon on the toolbar, then move the mouse over the column, and the distance from the wall will appear. Enter the value to modify it accordingly.

*(The following image shows the operation in an older interface, but the principle remains similar for dimension query/modification in 3D.)*

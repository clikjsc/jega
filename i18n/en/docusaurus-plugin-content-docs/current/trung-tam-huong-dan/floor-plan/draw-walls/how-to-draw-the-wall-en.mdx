Drawing walls can be done in three ways: rectangular wall drawing, inner line wall drawing, and center line wall drawing. This feature helps us freely draw walls and is more suitable for the operation choice after we measure the room on-site. Take inner line wall drawing to draw a 25-square-meter room as an example.

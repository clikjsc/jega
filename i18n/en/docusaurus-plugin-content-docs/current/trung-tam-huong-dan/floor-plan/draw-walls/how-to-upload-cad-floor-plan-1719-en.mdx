Hello, please upload the floor plan in the file - Import Floor Plan - Import CAD, or click on the column on the left - Floor Plan - Upload Sketch Map to upload the floor plan.

**Note:**

1.  It needs to be in dxf format;
2.  Close the walls, no need to leave other lines such as doors, windows, columns, and balconies;
3.  Use lines to close directly. After uploading and generating the walls, add them yourself.

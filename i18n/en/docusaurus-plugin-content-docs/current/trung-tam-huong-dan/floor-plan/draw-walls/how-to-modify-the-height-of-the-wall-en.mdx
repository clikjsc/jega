To modify the height of all walls, you can click Tools - Settings - Global Settings - Default Floor Height Modification (Note: This method is only effective when creating a new plan);

If the wall has already been drawn, you need to go to Floor Properties - Current Floor Height for modification (You can click on the blank area outside the apartment layout to access the Floor Properties).

Hello, by following the steps below, you can mirror the entire house type.

**Note:** The mirroring is limited to the house type. The items in the space need to be emptied, such as: sofas, custom tiles, ceiling and wall, the top/bottom/countertop lines of the cabinet need to be emptied. It is not possible to mirror with items. If an overlap prompt appears after mirroring, please check whether the walls are closed properly or overlapped.

1.  Use the one-click empty function to delete the hard decoration (ceiling, tiling), as well as the custom cabinet and closet to quickly empty for mirroring;

    *Footnote: It is recommended to save the plan separately before emptying.*

2.  Left-click to select any one of the spaces of the house type that needs to be mirrored (after selecting the space, it will turn blue), click the up-down and left-right mirroring directions above the design interface to complete the whole-house mirroring;

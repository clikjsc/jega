If you encounter an issue where a wall appears transparent or the ground seems empty in your AiHouse design, it's often due to an unclosed wall in the space.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Check for Unclosed Walls:**
    Carefully inspect your floor plan for any walls that are not properly closed or connected. An unclosed wall can lead to rendering issues where the wall appears transparent or parts of the ground do not display correctly.

2.  **Solution for Unclosed Walls:**
    If you find an unclosed wall, you should:
    *   Delete the problematic wall segment.
    *   Redraw the wall, ensuring it forms a closed loop with adjacent walls.

3.  **Handling Sections or Walls of Different Heights:**
    If the issue pertains to a section of a wall or a wall that intentionally has a different height (like a half-wall or a partition that doesn't reach the ceiling), it's better to replace these elements with **pillars** rather than drawing them as standard walls. Pillars are more suitable for such structural elements and can prevent transparency issues.

4.  **Recommended Wall Transparency Setting:**
    For general wall rendering, it is recommended to set the wall transparency to **100%** (which typically means fully opaque in most design software contexts, though AiHouse might have a specific interpretation here - the original text implies 100% is the desired state for non-transparent walls).

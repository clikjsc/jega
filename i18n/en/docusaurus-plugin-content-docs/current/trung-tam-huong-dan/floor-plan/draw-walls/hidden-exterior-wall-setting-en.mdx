Hello, during the drawing process, the exterior wall can be shown or hidden. The steps are as follows (Note: Exterior walls cannot be hidden on the rendering page):

Enter the design interface, click on a blank space, then go to Floor Properties > Wall Display.

*The following part of the original article seems to describe applying tiles, which might be slightly off-topic for "Hidden exterior wall setting" but was included in the fetched content. I'm including it as it was in the source.*

Left-click on "Public Library", enter Finishing --- Tiles, select the desired tile style, and drag and drop it onto the wall while holding down the left mouse button (Note: Currently, only ready-made tile images can be applied; custom tiles cannot be used).

Hello, wall writing can be achieved through the text function of free modeling and the import of CAD fonts for the top wall. The operation steps are as follows:

### First, Free Modeling:

1.  Enter free modeling, click on the text, input the text to be imported, modify the properties of the text. After confirmation, move the mouse to the place where it needs to be placed and click the left mouse button to confirm.

    *(Note: The image provided in the fetched content for this step seems to be a general UI screenshot, not specific to text input. I've used the first relevant image from the fetched data.)*

2.  *(The fetched content for step 2 of free modeling was missing a clear image, but it would typically involve extruding or giving depth to the text.)*

### Second, Import for the Top Wall:

1.  After editing the font shape in CAD, enter the top wall, click on the wall surface, import the shape, and import it in the local area.

### Luminous Font Production

#### First, Free Modeling Luminous Font

The new version of design operates as follows: (Only applicable to the new version)

1.  Enter Rendering - Lighting - Model Light;

    *(Note: The image here is a placeholder from the fetched content that seems to be a data URI of a loading spinner or a very small/corrupted image. A proper image would show the Model Light selection UI.)*

2.  Drag the model light to the operation area and assign it to the font.

    *(Note: Similar to the above, this image is also a placeholder data URI.)*

#### Second, Customized Top Wall Luminous Font

1.  After importing the text, you can select the text graphic, right-click and select the edge band, and drag the left lamp tube to add to the text graphic to make it luminous.

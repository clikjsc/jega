### Method 1: Use columns instead of walls.

If it needs to be suspended, modify the height above ground of the columns. The operations are as follows:

1.  In house type - structural members - drag and drop the columns by mouse and place them in the room;

2.  Stretch the column and change the size. If doors and windows need to be added to the column, note that: The length value represents the thickness of the wall, and the value should not be too large. It is recommended to be 120 or 240;

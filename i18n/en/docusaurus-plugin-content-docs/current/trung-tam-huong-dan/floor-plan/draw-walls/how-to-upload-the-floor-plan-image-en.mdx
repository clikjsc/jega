Hello, you can upload the floor plan in JPG/PNG image format, and the system can automatically recognize it as a 3D floor plan wall. The operation steps are as follows:

1.  Click Import Floor Plan;
2.  Click to select the image to upload, and click Open;
3.  Adjust the area of the floor plan. If the color of the wall is clear and obvious, you can click Smart Recognition. If the wall is not obvious, you need to click Draw the Wall Manually;
4.  Find a section of the wall, align the two ends of the scale with the length of the wall, enter the same value, and click OK.

In the design version, you need to draw the wall manually. You can adjust the floor transparency to display the copy drawing. The screenshots are as follows:

Hello, when designing a villa or a duplex floor, columns (pillars) can be effectively used to add doors and windows. However, please note that beams and floor platforms do not support this functionality.

When modifying the column parameters for this purpose, keep the following two points in mind:

1.  **Length (L value) Represents Wall Thickness:**
    *   The "Length" (L value) of the column represents the thickness of the wall where the door or window will be placed.
    *   This value should not be too large; it is recommended to use **240** or **120**.
    *   Ensure that **aspect ratio scaling is not checked** when modifying these dimensions, so you can set length, width, and height independently.

2.  **Height from Ground Must Be Initially 0:**
    *   The initial "Height from Ground" of the column must be set to **0**.
    *   If you intend to place the column (with its door/window) on an upper floor (e.g., the second floor), first set its height from the ground to 0. After placing the doors and windows onto this column, you can then adjust the column's height from the ground to position it correctly on the desired floor.

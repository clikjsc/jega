Hello, while the floor plan of a project cannot be directly copied as a separate entity, you can achieve a similar result by saving the same floor plan or the entire design scheme as a new, distinct project file.

To do this, simply click:

**File - Save As...**

![Using the File - Save As option in AiHouse](https://ai-study1.3vjia.com/aihouse-web/7468530d-f2c8-402d-a5c9-26d4a5bc662c.png)

This will create a new project file, allowing you to make further modifications without affecting the original project.
